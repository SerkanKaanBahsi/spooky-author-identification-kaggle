# Description
* This repository containts different models that I have used on [**spooky author identification**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/spooky-author-identification) dataset.
* The models I tried were: **LSTM**, **GRU**, **RNN**. I only tried models with 2 layers. Effects of different number of layers can be tested
* **BERT** model and other variations of BERT model can be tested as well.
